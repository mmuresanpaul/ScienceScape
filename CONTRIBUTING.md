# Contributing Guidelines

<br>

## Thank you

ScienceScapeS started off as a group project, and as students, the Codokans would like to thank you for contributing and making the application better.

## Before you contribute

We value your contribution very much. However there are some guidelines you MUST follow before you contribute.
First of all, please consult our code of conduct. It contains important information about contributing to such a project.

<a href="https://github.com/wonjoonSeol/ScienceScape/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md">Click here to read it now</a>

<hr/>

By contributing to ScienceScapeS, you agree to respect this code of conduct and the contents of our license.
You must also ask yourselves the following questions. All your answers should be YES before you contribute.
Nothing difficult, it's actually going to make the project better in the long run.

**1. Did you pull before making changes?**

Not pulling before you make changes can be dangerous for the project stability, and might break deployment. 

**2. Did you submit a pull request for merging?**

Do not merge directly to the master branch. Submit a pull request instead. It will be reviewed by delegated team members or representatives.

**3. Is your content appropriate?**

If your content is not appropriate, offensive, disrespectful or damages the project's integrity and good coding practices, measures will be taken to ensure your contribution is discarded.

**4. Did you test your code before pushing?**

If your code is not tested, it might uncover errors and damage the project's reputation.
Test all the code you write, to achieve the highest coverage.

**5. Did you refactor your code so others can understand?**

Refactored code is easier to debug, and build upon.
And always leave our code cleaner than you found it.

### If your answer to any of these questions is NO, we will decline your pull request, and your contribution will be ignored.
